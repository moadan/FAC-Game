# Game

This document will explain the code and provide some insight into my learning during the game development. 

- HTML: The html (canvas) element is a container which allows for the drawing of graphics and animations, using JavaScript.
(h1) for title.

- CSS: (canvas id="board") background-color, & border-top, bottom, styles. 


# Project, my understanding of the code.
image:1 show's the dimentions of canvas starting at (0.0) point or X, Y. width & height of 500px. Also the positioning of the player paddle, which is boarderheight/2, size of the paddle is stored in a variable (playerHeight = 100;)

<img src="/img's%20readme/1.png" alt="" width="900" height="400">
